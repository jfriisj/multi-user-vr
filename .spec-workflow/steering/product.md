# Product Overview

## Product Purpose

The Co-located Multi-user VR System addresses the critical gap in affordable VR solutions for shared physical spaces. While existing multi-user VR platforms connect users from different locations, this product solves the unique challenges of multiple users sharing the same physical room while collaborating in a virtual environment. 

The system enables **3 users with Meta Quest 3 headsets to safely operate in the same physical space** while experiencing synchronized virtual environments, addressing problems like tracking interference, collision prevention, and avatar-to-body alignment that don't exist in remote VR scenarios.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Training Facilities**: Organizations providing hands-on VR training programs requiring group interaction and collaboration
- **Educational Labs**: Schools and universities with VR programs needing multi-student experiences in controlled physical spaces  
- **Team-building Venues**: Corporate training centers and event spaces offering collaborative VR experiences

### User Needs and Pain Points
- **Cost Barrier**: Existing solutions like VIROO Rooms require expensive custom installations (32+ worldwide deployments indicate high cost)
- **Safety Concerns**: Users can't see each other physically while immersed, creating collision risks
- **Technical Complexity**: Managing multiple headsets in close proximity with potential tracking interference
- **Space Constraints**: Need to maximize use of limited physical room space while ensuring user safety
- **Scalability**: Need flexible solutions that don't require permanent installations

## Key Features

1. **Co-located Multi-user Support**: Precisely 3 Meta Quest 3 users operating simultaneously in the same physical room with real-time synchronization
2. **Collision Prevention System**: Advanced proximity detection, escalating warning system (visual alerts, haptic feedback), and movement restriction for user safety
3. **Tracking Interference Management**: Investigation and mitigation of inside-out tracking conflicts between multiple headsets in close proximity
4. **Shared Boundary Management**: Integration with Guardian systems to manage physical room constraints and prevent boundary violations
5. **Avatar Synchronization**: Real-time avatar positioning that accurately reflects users' actual physical positions for safety and immersion
6. **Affordable Hardware Approach**: Consumer Meta Quest 3 headsets instead of expensive custom installations

## Business Objectives

- **Cost Reduction**: Provide 10x+ cost savings compared to custom VR room installations like VIROO Rooms
- **Market Accessibility**: Enable training facilities and educational labs to adopt multi-user VR without major capital investment
- **Research Advancement**: Investigate and document co-located VR challenges to advance the field's understanding
- **Educational Impact**: Support learning objectives in VR development, networking, and safety systems
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Create reusable research and documentation for the broader VR development community

## Success Metrics

- **User Safety**: Zero physical collisions during multi-user sessions (primary safety metric)
- **Technical Performance**: <20ms latency for avatar synchronization between users (real-time requirement)
- **Tracking Reliability**: Successfully identify and mitigate any tracking interference scenarios
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Total system cost <$2000 (3x Meta Quest 3 + development) vs $50,000+ custom installations
- **Educational Goals**: Successful completion of 4-phase development milestones with regular demonstrations
- **Research Output**: Comprehensive documentation of tracking interference findings and mitigation strategies

## Product Principles

1. **Safety First**: User physical safety takes precedence over all other features - collision prevention is a first-class system, not an afterthought
2. **Research-Driven Development**: Every technical decision should be documented and investigated, contributing to broader VR knowledge
3. **Affordability Over Features**: Prioritize cost-effective solutions using consumer hardware rather than feature-rich expensive alternatives
4. **Co-location Advantages**: Design features that specifically leverage the benefits of users sharing physical space rather than simply adapting remote VR patterns
5. **Educational Transparency**: Development process and findings should be documented for learning and knowledge transfer

## Monitoring & Visibility

- **Dashboard Type**: Unity-based real-time monitoring system with VR and desktop views
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuous tracking of user positions, collision proximity, network synchronization status
- **Key Metrics Displayed**: 
  - User positions and proximity alerts
  - Network latency and synchronization status
  - Tracking quality indicators for each headset
  - Guardian boundary status and violations
  - Safety system activation history
- **Sharing Capabilities**: Research data export, demonstration recording, safety incident logging

## Future Vision

This project serves as a foundation for advancing affordable co-located VR experiences and contributing to academic/research understanding of multi-user VR challenges.

### Potential Enhancements
