# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the comprehensive documentation and diagram system needed to implement the co-located multi-user VR solution defined in the README and steering guide. The documentation will serve as the blueprint for Unity development, covering all technical aspects from system architecture to implementation patterns. This includes detailed diagrams that will guide developers through the complex interactions between networking, VR systems, safety mechanisms, and user experience components.

The documentation system will bridge the gap between high-level vision (steering documents) and concrete implementation, providing developers with clear visual guides, architectural patterns, and step-by-step implementation roadmaps for building a stable 3-user co-located VR system using Meta Quest 3 headsets.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product vision outlined in `product.md` by:

- **Educational Value**: Creating comprehensive documentation that serves as learning material for VR development students and researchers
- **Research Foundation**: Establishing documented patterns for co-located VR that can be analyzed and improved upon
- **Safety-First Approach**: Documenting safety system architectures that prevent user collisions in shared physical space
- **Affordable Implementation**: Providing clear implementation guides that reduce development time and complexity
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Creating reusable documentation patterns that can benefit the broader VR development community

The documentation aligns with the goal of making co-located VR accessible by removing the complexity barrier through clear, visual guides and proven implementation patterns.
